# HMM Decoding: Viterbi Algorithm

Programmatically implement the Viterbi algorithm to compute the most likely weather sequence and probability for any given observation sequence. Example observation sequences: 331, 122313, 331123312, etc.
Refer to input_image for transition probabilities.

Run the file using the folloeing command:

* Q1_b_Viterbi.py 'input sequence' 

where input sequence is the sequence of ice-creams for eg:	Q1_b_Viterbi.py 331122313
